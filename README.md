## Description

Simple web application for managing departments and employees. It uses RESTful web service to perform CRUD operations.
The web application allows:
- display a list of departments and the average salary (calculated automatically) for these departments;
- display a list of employees in the departments with an indication of the salary for each employee and search fields
to search for employees born in the period between dates;
- change (add_department / edit / delete) the above data.
